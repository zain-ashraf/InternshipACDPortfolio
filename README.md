## About Me
My name is Zain Ashraf, and I am a Third Year Computer Science with Business Applications major at the University of California, Riverside. This internship has taught me lots of valuable information on how to develop within IOS, and I couldn't be happier! There have definitely been some challenging moments, but the most challenging moments teach you the most in a course like this. Just 2 months ago I was using GitHub in school for a coding class I took, so coming back to it to continue working with it is pretty nice.
