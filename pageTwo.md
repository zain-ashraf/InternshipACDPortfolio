# Project 1: Apple Pie

Apple Pie is a word-guessing game with a limited number of attempts. Each player is challenged with guessing the letters in the word that is assigned and hidden. There is a set number of apples on the tree, which will fall off one by one each time the player gets a letter incorrectly. The bottom of the screen keeps track of the wins and losses and has a line of text above it that shows where you are with your guesses.
